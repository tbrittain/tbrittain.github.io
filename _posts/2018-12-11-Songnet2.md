I've been an avid user of Spotify since around 2012. 
The playlists I've created have quickly filled up with individual songs and I often find myself going back through some of my older playlists just to reminisce and observe how my musical tastes have changed over time.
It's always been in the back of my mind, though, that I should take it upon myself to visualize the distribution of my music somehow, and only recently I've gotten around to doing that.

I used [this tool](https://github.com/watsonbox/exportify) to export data about the three playlists I've kept the most updated: 
my old "Starred" playlist, [my playlist from 2014-2016](https://open.spotify.com/user/1223330425/playlist/76MKpEmomX49lnViUXyXCz?si=BcyD81gQRqGl9Te1MEVL3Q), and my playlist from [2017-present](https://open.spotify.com/user/1223330425/playlist/07DvQC3y4sQtOGcBkdO4AK?si=YFXumtxyQMywWZhwWXAvIw).

Unfortunately, one major detail was missing: genres. I arbitrarily classified every song (an arduous task for 2167 songs) by genre, those being Alternative, Metal, Rock, Rap/R&B, Indie, IDM or Bass.
Afterwards, I imported the finished data into [Gephi](https://gephi.org) and tinkered with the settings to output the final product. You can check that out [here](https://tbrittain.github.io/songnet/), and some screenshots below.
