I've been an avid user of Spotify since around 2012. 
The playlists I've created have quickly filled up with individual songs and I often find myself going back through some of my older playlists just to reminisce and observe how my musical tastes have changed over time.
It's always been in the back of my mind, though, that I should take it upon myself to visualize the distribution of my music somehow, and I've only recently gotten around to doing that.

I used [this tool](https://github.com/watsonbox/exportify) to export data about the three playlists I've kept the most updated: 
my old "Starred" playlist, [my playlist from 2014-2016](https://open.spotify.com/user/1223330425/playlist/76MKpEmomX49lnViUXyXCz?si=BcyD81gQRqGl9Te1MEVL3Q), and [my playlist from 2017-present](https://open.spotify.com/user/1223330425/playlist/07DvQC3y4sQtOGcBkdO4AK?si=YFXumtxyQMywWZhwWXAvIw).
Unfortunately, one major detail was missing: genres. I arbitrarily classified every song (an arduous task for 2167 songs) by genre, those being Alternative, Metal, Rock, Rap/R&B, Indie, IDM or Bass.
Afterwards, I imported the finished data into [Gephi](https://gephi.org) and tinkered with the settings to output the final product. You can check that out [here](https://tbrittain.github.io/songnet/), and some screenshots below.

For a while, I was pleased with the first iteration of this project. The umbrella genres I assigned to my music seemed suffucient, but additionally I wanted to see how the visualization would differ if I were to obtain the genre information directly from Spotify.
So I installed the R package [Spotifyr](https://www.rcharlie.com/spotifyr/) and retrieved all of the genre information for each artist in my library directly from Spotify. I was much more satisfied with the resulting graph. You can view it [here](https://tbrittain.github.io/songnet2/).

Some genres (ahem... [filthstep](http://everynoise.com/engenremap-filthstep.html), [escape room](http://everynoise.com/engenremap-vaportwitch.html) and [vapor twitch](http://everynoise.com/engenremap-vaportwitch.html) to name a few) I wasn't familiar with, so I discovered [Every Noise at Once](http://everynoise.com/engenremap.html), which is a pretty excellent, comprehensive catalog of every genre Spotify lists and helped to elucidate some of these strange genres for me.
