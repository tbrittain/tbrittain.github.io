While the experiment using data of my song library directly from Spotify went well, I had a slightly different idea for a visualization. I figured it would be interesting to see how all the individual artists in my Spotify library relate to each other solely through the outgoing links on their Wikipedia pages. 
I used [this](https://github.com/tomayac/wikipedia-tools-for-google-spreadsheets) Google Sheets add-on and specifically the function "=WIKIOUTBOUNDLINKS()" for each artist in my library to collect all of the outbound page data and assocate that data with the originating artist page. You can view the graph [here](https://tbrittain.github.io/artistwikinet/).

I was really pleased with how this project turned out because not only did it separate the artists based on genre, but it also placed other Wikipedia pages that weren't directly related to artists in genres where those pages were referenced to most often. 
At least within the constrants of my music library, you can observe how the various award ceremonies (Grammy's, Brit Awards, ARIA Awards, etc.) are located in terms of the genres most widely represented. There are a lot of trends that can be observed through this graph, and I think that is one of its greatest strengths. I plan on expanding on this project at a later date.
