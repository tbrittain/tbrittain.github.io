I'm using this site as a way to chronicle various projects I'm working onâ€”and for you to check out if you are interested.
I enjoy messing around with R and occasionally Python, and use [Gephi](https://gephi.org) for network visualizations.
### More Information

Some hobbies of mine include simulation games such as [Cities: Skylines](https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities_Skylines/) 
and [Factorio](https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/), as well as more strategy-based games such as Sid Meier's [Civilization V](https://store.steampowered.com/app/8930/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_V/).

I grew up playing RollerCoaster Tycoon [1](https://store.steampowered.com/app/285310/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_Deluxe/), [2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/285330/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_2_Triple_Thrill_Pack/) and [3](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2700/RollerCoaster_Tycoon_3_Platinum/), which led to a love for roller coasters and amusement parks in general. 
My favorite roller coaster I've been on thus far has been has been [Titan](https://guidetosfot.com/rides/titan/) at Six Flags over Texas (It was my dream as a kid to ride on it ever since [seeing the park in RCT2](https://i.imgur.com/dIzYfJH.png).
Someday I'd love to visit Cedar Point in Ohio and Blackpool Pleasure Beach in the UK, especially the latter since I've been in awe of that park ever since [seeing it in RCT1](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/7hRMGRZYQ-k/maxresdefault.jpg).

I also played (and still do occasionally play) [SimCity 4](https://store.steampowered.com/app/24780/SimCity_4_Deluxe_Edition/) which led to an appreciation of cities and skyscrapers (also huge shoutout to [Jerry Martin's legendary soundtrack](https://open.spotify.com/album/0V8y2gduUGML5uXwliLnsm?si=NbLV1tP0SfiTfAZ1dfo-Kw)). My current favorite skyscraper is [875 North Michigan Avenue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/875_North_Michigan_Avenue) in Chicago (which, whenever available, I use liberally in my cities: [1](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/943959514081091581/DC9383273B2203D91CEFA7FB323CA3A53A7E52A3/), [2](https://steamuserimages-a.akamaihd.net/ugc/916926747125711946/7B964F33C6DC77B71159453425F3169CCA83CFC4/)), and my favorite building currently under construction is [53W53](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/53W53) in NYC.
I also (used to, but still kind of do) make music under the moniker Keroscene.
