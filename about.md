I'm using this site as a way to chronicle various projects I'm working onâ€”and for you to check out if you are interested.
I enjoy messing around with Python, Javascipt, (and occasionally R and Java), and use [Gephi](https://gephi.org) for network visualizations.
### More Information

I am a prospective web/software developer located in Houston, Texas. I graduated from the University of St. Thomas in May of 2021 with a degree in Cell & Molecular Biology. My research focus was primarily in viral metagenomics, and in the past I have been involved with projects in the areas of the gut microbiome and DNA repair mechanisms.

Besides programming, in my free time I enjoy golfing and watching baseball and basketball. This might go without saying (due to the sheer amount of relevant projects I post on here), but I am definitely an audiophile and probably think about music and music-related activites a bit too much (just kidding... just the right amount for my liking).

I am also an avid user of audio editing (FL Studio & Cakewalk), video editing (Davinci Resolve), and photo editing (Paint.NET & Photoshop). I also like tinkering around with browser-based visual experiments on [Cables.gl](https://cables.gl/).
