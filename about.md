I'm using this site as a way to chronicle various projects I'm working on - and for you to check out if you are interested.
I enjoy messing around with R and occasionally Python, and use [Gephi](https://gephi.org) for network visualizations.
### More Information

Some hobbies of mine include simulation games such as [Cities: Skylines](https://store.steampowered.com/app/255710/Cities_Skylines/)
 and [Factorio](https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/). I also (used to, but kind of still do) make music under the moniker KEROSCENE.
